# Project description
This Project is regarding how to build a conversational Chatbot that listens and replies like a human. I used Speech Recognition tools to perform speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks, and I leveraged pre-trained Transformers language models to give the bot some Artificial Intelligence.
